### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location


## My process
It was my first experience with Tailwind CSS, a fantastic tool. I'm impressed and plan to use it more. I also got to work with various APIs and practice JavaScript. 

In this project, my goal was to make it as user-friendly as possible. I even went the extra mile to create a hypothetical Customer Journey Map to anticipate and accommodate all possible user interactions with the website. I made sure to handle all exceptions gracefully.

For instance, even though the challenge description didn't explicitly mention that users could input either an IP or a domain in the search, it was clear from the information on the placeholder in the screenshot. I wanted to ensure that users would have a smooth and intuitive experience, no matter how they chose to interact with the site.
